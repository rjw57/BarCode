                       !Fonts
                       ======

The Fonts directory contains fonts that are not 
resident in ROM. The characters available within 
them can be inspected using the Chars application.

The "Selwyn" font contains various symbols.

The "Portrhouse" font is intended primarily for 
screen use. At a nominal height of 10 points, it 
uses no grey pixels when rendered on a mode 12 or
mode 20 screen.  This font is only provided with 
the Latin1 character set.

The "System.Fixed" font precisely mimics the System
font built in to the machine. The tuned bitmap files
ensure that at a nominal height of 12 points there 
are no grey pixels when rendered on a mode 12 or 
mode 20 screen.  This font is only provided with the
Latin1 character set.

The "System.Medium" font contains the same 
characters as System.Fixed, butwith proportionally 
spaced metrics.  This font is only provided with the
Latin1 character set.

The "Sidney" font is included only to provide the 
new Encoding file for use by the new Font manager.
This file is also required if the PostScript
printer driver is to render Sidney on a PostScript 
device using the PostScript font "Symbol".  You 
should copy this "Sidney" font over your existing 
font, thus making a copy of the file "Encoding". If 
you do not have a copy of the "Sidney" font then you 
should ignore this directory and file.  It is not 
advisable to delete the Sidney directory since you
may require it in the future.
